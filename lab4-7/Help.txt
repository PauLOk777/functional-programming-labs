Hi everyone, it's helper to my programm :)
In this programm you can write your query and get result.
To exit from programm you need to write "quit", "QUIT", or "qUiT". You can try more variants and it will works.
Okay, this programm can read your *.csv or *.tsv files and you can filter this files by using SQL queries.
To check content of your file, you must write "select * from name_of_file". Name of file must contains extension.
You can do next queries:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID > 1
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND NOT condition2 OR condition3 ...
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC
-- Aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(Price) FROM Products
SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products
SELECT MIN(Price) FROM Products
-- 3 types of join
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name WHERE condition
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
-- You can combine all joins.
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s)
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
SELECT MIN(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) = 5 (and avg agrregate function)
-- You can use all types of aggregate functions which were given above.
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
 WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
 WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30" 
 ELSE "The quantity is under 30" 
END AS QuantityText FROM OrderDetails;
-- In case you can give alias, but you can omit this, but you can omit it only 1 time in 1 query
-- and it will has name "case".
Remark: please, dont paste ";" in the end of query. 
All conditions you must write seperated. You must paste spaces before and after operation "=" or ">".
You can use only "=" and ">". For example: "select * from test.csv where col1 > 2 and col2 = "Paul"" 
In clauses order by and group by you must write columns together. 
For example "select * from test.csv order by col1,col2,col3 DESC".
When you join your tables you must know that if 2 tables have same columns, second table will modified name of this columns.
And in next join you must write next expression: name_of_column(name_of_table). And if name of table contains "."
you must write it at square parentheses. For example:
"select * from test1.csv inner join test2.csv on [test1.csv].id = [test2.csv].id inner join test3.csv on [test2.csv].id(test2.csv) = [test1.csv].id"
That's all. Thank you for using this app :)
