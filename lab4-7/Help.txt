Hi everyone, it's helper to my programm :)
In this programm you can write your queryand get result.
To exit from programm you need to write "quit", "QUIT", or "qUiT". You can try more variants and it will work.
Okay, this programm can read your *.csv or *.tsv file and you can filter this files by using SQL queries.
To check content of your file, you must write "select * from name_of_file". Name of file must contains extension.
You can do next queries:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID > 1;
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND NOT condition2 OR condition3 ...;
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
-- Aggregate functions
SELECT COUNT(Price) FROM Products;
SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products;
SELECT MIN(Price) FROM Products;
-- 3 types of join
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name WHERE condition;
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
-- You can combine all joins.
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s);
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
SELECT MIN(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) = 5;
-- You can use all types of aggregate functions which were given above.
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
 WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN "The quantity is greater than 30"
 WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN "The quantity is 30" 
 ELSE "The quantity is under 30" 
END AS QuantityText FROM OrderDetails;
-- In case you can give alias, but you can omit this, but you can omit it only 1 time in 1 query
-- and it will has name "case".
